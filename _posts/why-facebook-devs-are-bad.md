## Unveiling Facebook's Developer and Quality Control Woes: My Frustration explained!

### Introduction

In today's digital age, social media platforms play a pivotal role in our lives. Facebook, being one of the pioneers of this era, has brought people from all corners of the globe together. However, as its user base has grown, so have the challenges, particularly in terms of its developer practices and quality control and let's not forget what the Covid-19 layoff as brought us. In this blog post, we'll delve into the reasons behind the frustrations users like you experience, shedding light on the issues with Facebook's developer team and quality control processes.

### The Unpleasant Experience

Have you experienced being locked out of your Facebook account due to a lost password? It's an all-too-familiar tale. The saga of trying to regain access to your account paints a disheartening picture of the struggles many users encounter. It's indeed frustrating to find oneself caught in a loop of submitting identification documents repeatedly,only to wait for extended periods with no guaranteed resolution.

### Facebook Developers: Missing the Mark

One of the primary reasons behind these user frustrations is the perception of Facebook's developer team falling short of expectations. While Facebook has a massive and aging user base and was at the forefront of technological advancements, their handling of user authentication issues, such as password recovery, often leaves users exasperated.

A significant part of the problem seems to be a lack of proactive problem-solving, the skill any developer should have. Users are forced into a reactive loop, only receiving assistance when they've already encountered issues. This raises questions about the effectiveness of Facebook's development practices and their commitment to user satisfaction.

### Quality Control Quandaries

Another aspect that adds to the frustration is the apparent inadequacy or just lack of Facebook's quality control processes. To this day, when you request a phone verification, you get a 6 digits number while Facebook ask you to enter an 8 digits number, so the two-factor authentication (2FA) code is sent with an incorrect number of digits, that exemplifies the slip-ups that can occur. Such a basic oversight raises concerns about the thoroughness of testing and validation procedures.

Quality control is an essential part of any software development process, more precisely, the devops team, ensuring that the end product functions as intended. However, instances like the 6-digit code discrepancy demonstrate that even tech giants like Facebook are not immune to lapses in their quality control processes, again, if there is...

### Conclusion

In a world where technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, user experiences can vary widely. While Facebook's developer team and quality control processes might have their shortcomings, more often than not, it's essential to remember that change is possible but not likely. Companies can learn from their mistakes and work toward creating a better user experience for all. Let's hope, but not too hard...

As users, sharing our frustrations and expectations can drive companies to prioritize the enhancement of their services. So, while your journey to regain access to your Facebook account might have been arduous, it's a reminder that every user's voice matters and can contribute to the overall improvement of digital platforms we rely on daily, or the one's that our grand parents rely one, let's not forget them and show them that they can still learn new platforms.
